theory

actions based on rounds of days

USER INPUTS(?)
 - Mutation (+- by entered value)
 - Energy per food
 - Number of food
 - number of individuals
 - time per day
 - initial speed, size, sights
    - for each individual OR for all

HOME: edges of the platform
 - individuals start day on homes
 - when the day ends, they must move home, direcly to the edge of the platform. No other actions will be performed on their way hom.
 - energy is used during return to home
 - AT THE END OF EACH DAY COLLECT EACH INDIVIDUAL:
    - AGE
    - SPEED
    - SIZE
    - SIGHT
    - Total population

Individuals
 - if they run out of energy, they die.
 - if they get 2 food during the day and get home, they will reproduce. A mutation will occur on the offspring.
    - the offspring and the parent evenly splits the energy (floored).
 - INFO values: Speed, size, sight, energy, age.

Mutations (slightly greater/smaller when reproduce)
 - Speed (distance per tick)
 - Size
    - you can eat other individuals as food if you are >=20% larger.
    - those prey will move direcly away from the predator
    - larger sizes move faster even at the same speed value (larger steps)
 - Sight
    - a circular area around each individual
    - An individual only knows if a food/other individual if it is in the area of sense.
    - Other times, the individual randomly moves around.

Energy
 - energy usage per tick move = (size^3)(speed^2) + sight
 - homologous to equation of kinetic energy 1/2 m v^2
